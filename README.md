# 👨‍💻 Daniel | Systems Architect & Full-Stack Developer

Welcome to my GitHub profile — a space where architecture meets execution, and modular thinking drives scalable innovation.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a systems architect and lead developer with a strong focus on building robust, modular applications across Web, Mobile, and Android platforms. My core expertise lies in designing and implementing scalable solutions using **Flutter**, backed by a deep understanding of backend systems and cross-platform integration.

I specialize in transitioning monolithic Java architectures to modern, modular stacks using **Flutter**, **Node.js**, and **Firestore**, while ensuring clean documentation, governance, and developer onboarding.

## 🧠 Core Competencies

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Expert in Flutter for building high-performance Web, Android, and iOS applications.
- **Backend Engineering**: Skilled in Node.js, Firestore, and RESTful API design.
- **Legacy Modernization**: Migration of Java monoliths to modular architectures.
- **System Architecture**: Strategic planning of roles, access control, and audit systems for educational platforms.
- **Technical Governance**: Documentation standards, onboarding workflows, and scalable project structures.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Delivering a centralized administration platform (**ADMIN-UNIMAP**) with autonomous modules and fine-grained role management.
- Finalizing Flutter/Android Studio configuration and troubleshooting on Windows 11.
- Formalizing academic roles and concepts for international documentation standards.

## 🌍 Vision

My long-term goal is to architect a modular, secure, and internationally recognized **University Management System (UMS)** that meets the evolving needs of higher education institutions worldwide.
